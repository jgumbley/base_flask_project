                                    historical picture postcards of britain

        This site hopes to be a Picture Postcode Archive and Database toolset, with added bulletin board features
        bolted on. The hope is to attract and retain visitors interested in British local history and collecting
        historical Picture Postcards. Over time location, transcribed messages, philately and off-topic messaging
        could be introduced. Ultimately, subtle advertising, private collections and postcard trading may monetise
        the site.
