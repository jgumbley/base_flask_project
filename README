          __BASE FLASK PROJECT__

        Was the postcode website but
        now its just the template
        for Flask based websites I
        might decide to make.

              SAD DEVELOPMENT

        ep.io have given up because
        they think heroku is really
        awesome.

        Heroku does seems quite good
        but migrating everything is
        going to be a pain in the
        ass.

        Heroku Migrated Features:
            - bootstrap css
            - heroku deploy


        Ep.io Features
            - sqlalchemy
            - db migrations
            - heroku deploy
            - twitter authentication
            - models for content
            - upload images
